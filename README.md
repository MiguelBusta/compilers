## Development Report
### Introduction
The purpose of this document is to explain and explore the creation of a translator that acts like a compiler. The experiment has the capability of graphing the path that the compiler uses to access the values defined in our gramatic.
### Translator Design
---
The translator use the following structure:
* Importing libraries to be used.
* Define imported tokens from libraries. 
* Define the accepted tokens. 
* Define accepted special simbols.
* Define Token management.
* Node visiting process.
* Checking the text file. 
### Image Processing
---
The code being worked on has the capability to run a command and return the matrix of the values of a image using the command of: 
```
execute

load nameofthefile
```
Example 

```
load cv2.png
```

After being executed the file will show the following:
